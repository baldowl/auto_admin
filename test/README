As I haven't done anything clever yet, to run the tests for the
AutoAdmin plugin, you need auto_admin_test, which is a simple Rails
application (just a database, and matching models with assocations).

  http://trebex.net/~matthew/auto-admin-0.0/auto-admin-test-0.0.tar.gz

The database used is a manual Rails-ification of Pagila [1], from CVS,
as at whenever I went looking for one. The database dump almost
certainly contains PostgreSQL-specific stuff; I'll address that at some
point, and quite possibly move to an SQLite database, for that matter.

Once that application is set up, you need to install the plugin, and
then run the tests from the installed plugin's directory:

  ruby test/all_test.rb ../../..

Suggestions to make this work better are very welcome. :)
